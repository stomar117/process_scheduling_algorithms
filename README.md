# Process Scheduling Algorithms

This project consists of simple process scheduling algorithms namely,
- First Come First Serve
- Shortest Job First
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin Scheduling

The project uses concurrency to simulate dynamic queueing and execution of processes.

##Note
- Execution of processes refers to the worker sleeping for the time requested by each process(since these processes are just dummy processes)
- This is not an exact mechanism followed by the schedulers used in our operating systems

## Dependencies
- `gcc` or `mingw` is required to run this this code
- `meson` is an optional dependecy but if you have it installed then it is great
